            - "Service Brake State"
    -   step: "Whilst observing the CAN messages from the data logger power cycle LV system and enter 'AS Ready' state. Vehicle enters 'AS Ready' state, ASSI are yellow and continuous. Vehicle is not in Ready to Drive, that is the state is not in AS Ready."

        measurements:
            - "Autonomous System State"
    -   step: "Press on-board shutdown button while vehicle is in 'AS Ready' state. Vehicle transitions to 'AS Emergency' state, ASSI is blue and flashing, EBS is activated and brakes are engaged."

            - "Service Brake State"
    -   step: "Turn off ASMS and reset EBS. Power cycle LV system and enter 'AS Driving' state again with inspection mission still selected. Vehicle transitions to 'AS Driving' state, ASSI are yellow and flashing. Drivetrain is slowly spinning and steering system is actuating in sine wave (visual inspection as well as checking steering angles)."

    -   step: "Ensure that once any autonomous mission has been selected and activated no other method of control is possible, i.e. remote control. Receiving information from the vehicle via one-way-telemetry is allowed. The only device that is allowed to send commands by wireless communication at all times is the RES described."
